# Definitely Signed

Don't you hate it, when you need to sign something but just can't see yourself wasting ink on
something you will definitely throw away the moment a copy is sent by e-mail?

Me too.

With definitely signed you can select a photo of a handwritten signature, filter away the paper
background and place it on a pdf document.

Files do not leave your browser, everything is done in javascript.

## Im not a lawyer

Whether or not a photo of your signature slapped on a pdf is legally binding is probably debatable.

Legally speaking, definitely-signed is of course only meant as a party trick to fool your friends.
